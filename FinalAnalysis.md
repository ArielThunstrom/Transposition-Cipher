## Final Analysis

The Transposition Cipher stopped being useful because they do not change the letters in the plaintext or even cover up frequencies, but they can be built upon to make more secure methods of encryption. One example of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher which is much better.

But while it was used, it was a good cipher. It was used by the Union Army and in ancient Greece.

Other similar ciphers are the Scytale cipher and rail fence cipher which used the principles of the tranposition cipher to make much better ciphers.

One example is when when the Spartans created the Scytale cipher which was a device that had a scramble of letters and needed a certain type of stick to decode the cipher. This was great for secret messages because even if it was intercepted, without the corresponding stick to wrap around the message, the cipher couldn't be solved.

Overall, The transposition cipher has good principles which made it great for creating new ciphers but by itself it isn't very good because it doesn't change letters and they key is easily guessable.
