 * This website does a great job of explaining how the Transposition Cipher works:
https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/simple-transposition-ciphers.html#:~:text=One%20example%20of%20a%20transposition,which%20the%20words%20are%20written.


* How does this website work?
  * Scroll down to the Crypto Corner box, this is where you can enter a message to encrypt. 
  * At the top you can enter in any alphabet that you want the cipher to use. The defult alphabet is just the standard english alphabet.
  * Click the encypt button and then you can actually see the cipher encode the message one letter at a time. If you want to see the cipher decrypt the messege just click the decrypt button and you can see it decrypt one letter at a time.
